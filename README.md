## Features
- Multiple signature templates catering to different units of the organization
- Real-time preview of the generated email signature
- User-friendly interface designed for ease of use

## Installation and Deployment
1. Create a Google Apps Script project.
2. Copy the code from `Code.gs` and `Index.html`.
3. Edit the styling of the templates to suit your needs.
4. Deploy the project as a web app from the Google Apps Script environment.
